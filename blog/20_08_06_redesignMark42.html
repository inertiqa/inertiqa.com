			<p>If you by any chance have reached the gallery where I collected some of the <a href="../blob/logotypes/" target="_blank">logotypes I've made,</a> you probably noticed a certain <i>feeling</i> around them. Yes I was a designer for more than 10 years, and the style that resonated with me the most was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Typographic_Style" target="_blank">International Typographic Style</a> or Modernism for short.</p>
			<p>Modernism, as pretty much any old school trend, is more than dead by now. Ocassionaly rising from the grave to ride the next <i>coolness fad</i> that some retro Netflix series unleashes to the world.</p>
			<p>Modernism can be argued that is just another style, and when in need, just use it to complete the job on a timely manner.</p>
			<p>But for me, Modernism <i>is</i> the answer. You need typography? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica" target="_blank">Here's Helvetica.</a> You need to place stuff? <a href="http://anacoquet-discourse.blogspot.com/2013/05/grid-systems.html" target="_blank">Here's grid.</a> You need logotypes? <a href="https://logo-archive.org/" target="_blank">Here's geometry.</a> In fact for any problem you'll ever encounter on graphic design, Modernism have you covered with a solution as solid as naked concrete on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture" target="_blank">brutalist building.</a> Accounting the periods where the styles were at their primes, well, it's no surprise they are the same.</p>
			<p>This is not the first iteration of this site, in fact, I was searching for <i>my perfect homepage style</i> at least since 2002 where I first started to mess with HTML, and dozens upon dozens of designs and mockups and concepts and HTML playgrounds came and go.</p>
			<p>None of it was good enough. Too trendy. Too conceptual. Too unusable. Too generic.</p>
			<p>Around 2012 a simple question arised: What would be the website of the ones like <a href="https://www.paulrand.design/" target="_blank">Paul Rand?</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Müller-Brockmann" target="_blank">Josef-Müller Brockmann?</a> <a href="http://www.designishistory.com/1960/yusaku-kamekura/" target="_blank">Yusaku Kamekura?</a> <a href="http://www.designishistory.com/1960/wim-crouwel/" target="_blank">Wim Crouwel?</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams" target="_blank">Dieter Rams?</a>.</p>
			<p>As usually happens with Modernism, the pure, distilled, no-nosense approach inevitably leads to concentrate and play with only the microscopic details that you are left with. It's like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/" target="_blank">pixelart.</a> They're small, they don't have lots of colors, but you can create <i>atomic levels</i> of detail where every pixel counts. Any good modernism design is just like that.</p>
			<p>Modifying any element of a Modernist design will absolutely ruin it? If so, your design <i>is</i> Modernism.</p>
			<p>After all that many years discarding designs, realizing I was going nowhere with my webpage, the point that arised to prominence was <i>it has to endure</i> and <i>it has to communicate</i>. And again, the absolute purity that Modernism bring to the table assures that the design you are left with <b>delivers</b>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>This site sports <i>only one font in only one weight</i>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet_MS" target="_blank">Trebuchet.</a></li>
				<li>This site automatically takes care of the light theme / dark theme for you.</li>
				<li>Link colors adjusted for optimal contrast.</li>
				<li>Perfect mobile experience.</li>
				<li>The horizontal scrollbar <i>never</i> apperars (Except for inline code).</li>
				<li>Scores a perfect 100 / 100 on Google Insights.</li>
				<li>And so on.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In fact what you see on the index it's one of the temptative first designs that I came up with when I tried to answer the Modernist question years ago. The design was pure, certainly based on Modernist posters, absolutely typography centered... but look after look, the design <i>stood</i>.</p>
			<p>Stood webdesign trends. Stood accesibility tests. Stood content-fist approach theory. Stood responsive migration. Stood css flexbox <i>and</i> grid migration. Well, it stood <i>fckuing everything</i>. As the design is so unforgivingly pure, it succeeded on everything the world threw at it because it pretty much discarded everything and keep what it was <i>essential</i> and nothing else. It was <i>spectacular</i> to watch it work.</p>
			<p class="q"><q>It’s also a worthwhile reminder that great design is a product of constraints.</q>

			<p>About a year after inception I realized it was good enough to become the index of my page, there was nothing else, the links were broken, didn't know how to follow. Little by little I realized that I just cannot modify it: it was too balanced, too perfect in its own terms to resist any new addition. And when I finally needed a place to forever archive my experiments and rants, the <i>only</i> solution was straight out duplicate the index, and then everything clicked: the index design <i>is</i> the design theme, and then this site finally born, and born to last.</i></p>
