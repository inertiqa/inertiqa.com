			<p>MAYBE someday you waked up from bed, and thought to yourself: <i>"Wouldn't be cool to program for the ZX Spectrum?"</i>. After all, if you are aboard this <i>computer stuff</i> as long as I do, probably you are not alien to the concept of BASIC of even Machine Code.</p>
			<p>Recently there was quite an interesting community raising on youtube, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8t99gp5IN-FTf5rGVaRevw" target="_blank">Chibi Akumas programming channel</a> (and the obligatory discord server). The guy not only teaches asm on the ZX Spectrum, but pretty much on every machine under the sun.</p>
			<p>Well programming on the ZX Spectrum always felt like a loose string on my agenda, and the videos seemed comprehensive enough to give it a try (again...). But!.</p>
			<p>The toolchain felt extremely convoluted. There was no easy way to make the computer run your neat asm code straight away. Not to mention using quite a few external libraries <i>and</i> a couple of programs more to bring the assembled bytecode to executable format for your emulator (or real device with everdrive...) to run.</p>
			<p>As it usually happens, it was somehow easier to do than expected. The biggest mistake was to use a generic compiler instead of a specific ZX Spectrum compiler. After testing out pretty much anything I could found, <a href="https://github.com/sjasmplus/sjasmplus/wiki" target="_blank">SjASMPlus</a> and <a href="http://pasmo.speccy.org/" target="_blank">Pasmo</a> were the only challengers left.</p>
			<p>I tried really hard to make Pasmo work since it's an original work from another fellow Spanish dude :p. But the compiler just straight out refused to create the executable file for the emulator to run, so I just surrended that end and moved on.</p>
			<p>But, SjASMPlus... oh boy, it worked <i>on the first try</i>.</p>
			<p>Everything can be placed inside main.asm and just place handy compiler directive at the end of the file to create a useful executable:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-asm6502">org $8000						;code origin

start:
ld hl, string					;address of string

[...]

string: db "Hello World!", 0

SAVETAP "../release/tape.tap", start
;save tape file, autolaunch start address is $8000</code></pre>
			<p>And it delivers a sweet .tap file! No external programs or anything. Now with a working executable at hand, its just a matter of feeding it to <a href="http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Fuse</a> via your typical commands script:</p>
			<pre><code class="lang-batch">emulator\fuse.exe --machine 48 --tape release\tape.tap -g 2x</code></pre>
			<p>And sure enough:</p>
			<img src="img/20_07_16_zxSpectrumToolchain/helloWorldZXSpectrum.svg" />
			<p>It's still true that debugging asm code through an open source emulator is quite a step up for the average programmer student, but now setup is a breeze. And from my days learning C, the last thing you want to deal with when learning a new language are hellish toolchains.</p>
			<p>Now let's see if I can program <i>that game</i> on the ZX Spectrum at last. Surely this wouldn't be the last time talking about ZX Spectrum programming around here...</p>
